    <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!</h1>
    <p>
        My name is David Munroe and I'm the designer of this website. This website is a WIP for my Multimedia class at ESUMS. I'm currently a senior,
      and I like running, drawing, and playing chess in my free time. I hope to get a little bit more experience with website building before the end of the year
      and if this game project goes well I might also do game dev in my free time.

    <h1> What is a Game to Me?</h1>
    <p>
      
      To me, a game is any type of challenge, physical or mental, regardless of difficulty, with a certain objective. Although games can go on indefinitely,
      this doesn't rule out that all games have a specific point, ranging from being the last one standing in a shooter game, to collaborating to keep a ball in the air.
      Personally, when it comes to games, I'm both an achiever and an explorer. I love winning, but more than winning the game I like to experience and learn the ins and
      outs of the world. That's why I used to love Roblox games, because of all the different worlds. Right now one of my favorite games is Worldbox. The interesting thing
      about it is because it's a simulator game, you can technically choose your goal, however, ultimately the objective is to be overseer of a world that you create.
